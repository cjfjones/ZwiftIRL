Upload your real-life photo and add the [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com) user interface over the top!

This is all done in the browser using React and HTML Canvas, without the need for a server to compose
the image. I didn't know this was possible until I started this project, but it turns out Canvas
is pretty powerful and well supported.

The original project was pretty much made in a day. I'm now working on it in the evenings and weekends to add a few more features. If you have an idea and want to contribute, please start by making an issue so we can discuss it.

Hosted with [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) which is a great way of hosting front-end apps. Styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), which is awesome.
